        //数学问题，解一个方程即可
        /*let’s define sum as the sum of all the numbers, before any moves; minNum as the min number int the list; n is the length of the list;

After, say m moves, we get all the numbers as x , and we will get the following equation

 sum + m * (n - 1) = x * n
and actually,

  x = minNum + m
and finally, we will get

  sum - minNum * n = m
So, it is clear and easy now.*/
